# notes-assist
Since it's pandemic time, everybody has to attend their classes online, and taking notes is really exhausting so most of us prefer to take screenshots during the classes and use them as notes. But we also need to organize those screenshots later, which is again a tedious job. So I decided to make a program that does the job for us. Also i'm a newbie at python so my code wouldn't that good. I created this program with whatever i could learn in a single night.

Update: I've made few changes(added some features) and made it look better. It does have few bugs, which  I'll to fix as soon as i can.

(P.S.: When I was about to upload it on Github. I thought I'd name it "Snap-notes" but when I googled "Snap Notes" I found out that there's already an app with the same functionality, available on google play store.)
