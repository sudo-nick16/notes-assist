# notes-assist
Since it's pandemic time, everybody has to attend their classes online, and taking notes is really exhausting so most of us prefer to take screenshots during the classes and use them as notes. But we also need to organize those screenshots later, which is again a tedious job. So I decided to make a program that does the job for us. Also i'm a newbie at python so my code wouldn't be that good.


# If you want the python code of the software :
Download the "notes-assist.zip" file from the repo and DM me on instagram for the password of that archive file.(Insta ID: sudo_nick)
