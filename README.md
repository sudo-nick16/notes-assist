# notes-assist
Since it's pandemic time, everybody has to attend their classes online, and taking notes is really exhausting so most of us prefer to take screenshots during the classes and use them as notes. But we also need to organize those screenshots later, which is again a tedious job. So I decided to make a program that does the job for us. Also i'm a newbie at python so my code ain't that good.
